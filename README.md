## Part 1: Imaging Technique Inspiration
### *Particle Systems*
For my project, I am inspired by the stars and galaxies (usd as particles) in space-themed artworks. I believe this imaging technique and use of particles can transcend the space theme and become a simple but effective interactive element in all kinds of artwork, fitting various themes or concepts within the project. This technique can create visual effects that have vast and dynamic feature. By integrating this into my project, I can offer an interactive experience where viewers can influence or navigate particle patterns, making the artwork feel alive and responsive. Also the technique can enhance visual engagement and be versatile to my other project member's designs.
